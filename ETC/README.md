Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

**1. When can you start?**

As soon as I am allowed to move to engineering and if necessary, a technical support representative is able to replace my position in the department. 

**2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?**

Monday-Friday (~9:30am to ~6pm). On certain days when I teach dance, I leave early. Usually, it is on Wednesdays at 3:00pm-3:30pm during the Fall, Winter, and Spring. If I am subbing a class or helping out (which is rare), I might be out for a long lunch or leave slightly early. If necessary, I try to catch up on the workload and make up hours by working from home.

**3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)**

My current salary as a technical support representative (~$42,000 yearly) to about ~$50,000 yearly as a SparkFun engineer.

**4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?**

Of course I love dogs! I love seeing puppies and dogs. I do not currently have a dog because my living situation does not allow dogs. 

**5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?**

I am a bboy (dancer) by heart so you can say that I am an artist. Of course, I try to work on side projects off the clock to keep up with my skills in engineering.

**6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?**
